## About Me
I'm a young and motivated computer engineering graduate with project experience in embedded systems design and image processing. As well, I have two years of Co-Operative experience dealing with cost analytics and VBA automation.

Through my internships as a Project Analyst and a Document Control Specialist, I have demostrated how to effectively reduce timelines on projects, meet key objectives and handle large workloads in a fast-paced environment. 

### Projects
I have highlighted a few projects below that I have thoroughly enjoyed and learned a lot from.

#### Project 1: Image Decompressor
This project was completed during my time as an undergrad at McMaster University where I had to design hardware to reverse the McMaster Image Compression (.mic10) algorithm using Verilog on an FPGA.
