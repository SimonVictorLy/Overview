## About Me
I'm a young and motivated computer engineering graduate with project experience in embedded systems design and image processing. As well, I have two years of Co-Operative experience dealing with cost analytics and VBA automation.

Through my internships as a Project Analyst and a Document Control Specialist, I have demostrated how to effectively reduce timelines on projects, meet key objectives and handle large workloads in a fast-paced environment.
