## About Me
I am a recent computer engineering graduate from McMaster University with experience in embedded systems design and image processing. As well, I have two years of co-operative experience working with data/cost analytics and VBA automation.

Through my internships as a Project Analyst and a Document Control Specialist, I have demostrated how to effectively reduce timelines on projects, meet key objectives and handle large workloads in fast-paced environments. 

### Projects
I have highlighted a few projects below that I enjoyed and learned a lot from.

#### Project 1: Image Decompressor
[HW-Image-Decompressor](https://github.com/SimonVictorLy/HW-Image-Decompressor)

This project was completed during my time as an undergrad at McMaster University where I had to design hardware to reverse the McMaster Image Compression (.mic10) algorithm using Verilog on an FPGA.
